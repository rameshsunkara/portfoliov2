## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

1. Make sure you have Node.js â‰¥22.0.0 installed. You can use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions:

   ```sh
   nvm install 22
   nvm use 22
   ```

2. Install yarn if you haven't already

   ```sh
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   yarn gatsby develop
   ```

Note: If you encounter any cache-related issues:

```sh
# Clean Gatsby cache and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules .cache public package-lock.json yarn.lock
yarn install
yarn gatsby clean && yarn gatsby develop
```

## ï¿½ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you're using Node.js version 22 or higher
2. Clear all caches and dependencies:
   ```sh
   rm -rf node_modules .cache public package-lock.json yarn.lock
   yarn cache clean
   ```
3. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
4. Try cleaning and rebuilding:
   ```sh
   yarn gatsby clean
   yarn gatsby develop
   ```
5. If you still have issues, try running with verbose logging:
   ```sh
   GATSBY_LOGGER=verbose GATSBY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 yarn gatsby develop
   ```
6. For permission-related issues:
   ```sh
   sudo rm -rf .cache public
   mkdir -p .cache public
   sudo chmod -R 777 .cache public
   yarn gatsby develop
   ```

Note: The `.cache` directory is critical for Gatsby's operation. Always ensure it exists
before running gatsby develop, and make sure you have write permissions for it.

## ï¿½ðŸš€ Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   yarn build
   ```

2. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

   ```sh
   yarn serve
   ```
